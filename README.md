# Image-Classification
This repo contains tutorials covering image classification using [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
 1.7, [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision) 0.8, [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) 3.3 and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) 0.24, with Python 3.8.

Firstly, we will implement a multilayer perceptron (MLP), then proceed with architectures that utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as [LeNet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/), [AlexNet](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/alexnet.html), [VGG](https://towardsdatascience.com/vgg-neural-networks-the-next-step-after-alexnet-3f91fa9ffe2c), and [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).

Don't hesitate to submit an issue if you find any mistakes or disagree with any of the explanations. I'm open to feedback, whether it's positive or negative!

# Getting Started
To install PyTorch, see installation instructions on the PyTorch website.
The instructions to install PyTorch should also detail how to install torchvision but can also be installed via:
