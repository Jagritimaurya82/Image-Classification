# Image-Classifiaction
 Image classification is where a computer can analyse an image and identify the ‘class’ the image falls under. (Or a probability of the image being part of a ‘class’.) A class is essentially a label, for instance, ‘car’, ‘animal’, ‘building’ and so on.
For example, you input an image of a sheep. Image classification is the process of the computer analysing the image and telling you it’s a sheep

Image classification has a few uses — and vast potential as it grows in reliability. Here are just a few examples of what makes it useful.

Self-driving cars use image classification to identify what’s around them. I.e. trees, people, traffic lights and so on.

Image classification can also help in healthcare. For instance, it could analyse medical images and suggest whether they classify as depicting a symptom of illness.
