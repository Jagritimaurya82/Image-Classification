# Image-Classification
This repo contains tutorials covering image classification using [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
 1.7, torchvision 0.8, matplotlib 3.3 and scikit-learn 0.24, with Python 3.8.

Firstly, we will implement a multilayer perceptron (MLP), then proceed with architectures that utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet.

Don't hesitate to submit an issue if you find any mistakes or disagree with any of the explanations. I'm open to feedback, whether it's positive or negative!

# Getting Started
To install PyTorch, see installation instructions on the PyTorch website.
The instructions to install PyTorch should also detail how to install torchvision but can also be installed via:
