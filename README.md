# Image-Classification
This repository contains tutorials covering image classification using [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
 1.7, [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision) 0.8, [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) 3.3 and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) 0.24, with Python 3.8.

Firstly, we will implement a multilayer perceptron (MLP), then proceed with architectures that utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as [LeNet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/), [AlexNet](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/alexnet.html), [VGG](https://towardsdatascience.com/vgg-neural-networks-the-next-step-after-alexnet-3f91fa9ffe2c), and [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).

#### Don't hesitate to [submit an issue](https://github.com/Jagritimaurya82/Image-Classification/issues) if you find any mistakes or disagree with any of the explanations. I'm open to feedback, whether it's positive or negative!

# Getting Started
To install PyTorch, see installation instructions on the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) website.
The instructions to install PyTorch should also detail how to install torchvision but can also be installed using Python Package Index (PyPI):<br>
Install torchvision :[`pip install torchvision`](https://pypi.org/project/torchvision/)<br>
Install matplotlib :[`pip install matplotlib`](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)<br>
Install scikit-learn :[`pip install scikit-learn`](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)<br>
Install numpy :[`pip install numpy`](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)<br>
 
 


# Tutorials
## 1-[Multilayer Perceptron](https://github.com/Jagritimaurya82/Image-Classification/blob/main/1_MLP_MNIST.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Jagritimaurya82/Image-Classification/blob/main/1_MLP_MNIST.ipynb)
 
In this tutorial, you will be introduced to PyTorch and TorchVision, and learn various techniques such as loading datasets, data augmentation, creating a multilayer perceptron (MLP), training the model, observing the outputs, visualizing the model's representations, and examining the model's weights. The tutorial will be demonstrated using the MNIST dataset which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
